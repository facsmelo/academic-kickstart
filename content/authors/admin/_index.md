Francisco S. Melo is an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) of [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](http://www.tecnico.ulisboa.pt), and a Senior Researcher at [INESC-ID](http://www.inesc-id.pt), working with the [Group on Artificial Intelligence for People and Society](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt).

His main research interests are in machine learning and decision-theoretic planning, and in the exploration of models and algorithms from these fields of AI that may enable the development of intelligent autonomous agents capable of interacting with other agents (human or artificial) in complex, possibly unknown environments. His research thus lies at the intersection of different sub-fields within artificial intelligence, such as decision-theoretic planning (and its applications to human-robot interaction and collaborative multi-agent scenarios), general reinforcement learning, active learning, and interactive machine learning.
