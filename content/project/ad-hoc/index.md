**Description**: 

As the number of robots continue to increase, we expect to see robots interacting more and more with a variety of other robots and humans. In many of these interactions, the robots may share the same goal and consequently cooperate to achieve that goal. However, many robots may not have coordination and standard communication protocols, because they have been designed by different developers and at different times. Hence, robots have to observe the teammates, reason about their strategy and act in order to achieve the common goal.

This area of research is called __ad hoc teamwork__ and is focused on building learning agents, such as softbots or robots, that engage in cooperative tasks with other unknown agents. In this project, we focus on human-robot teamwork: ad hoc teams of humans and robots. The project aims to go beyond the typical "master-slave" and "one-robot-one-human" type of interaction, pushing step changes in the current state-of-the-art in terms of human-robot interactions.

The two main project goals are to explore the scientific and technological challenges involved in:

* Developing symbiotic human-robot interactions in ad hoc teams. In particular, we test the technology in the context of a physical game involving humans and robots in order to investigate how to extend ad hoc teamwork methods and multi-agent planning under uncertainty to cooperative scenarios involving human and robot agents. 

* Developing robust forms of natural interaction, including natural language interactions, and how contextual and environment information, collected by a sensor network, can improve the interaction between robot and human agents during joint collaborative tasks involving activities in a physical environment.
