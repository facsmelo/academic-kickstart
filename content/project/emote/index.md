**Description**: 

The EMOTE project investigated how robot tutors that respond to learners can offer a new and exciting approach to learning. Human teachers respond to a myriad of cues and a key aspect for the human teacher-learner experience is empathy, with teachers understanding when learners are confused or puzzled and responding appropriately. 

Now, with the advent of social robotics, robot tutors will be able to do just that. EMOTE developed a new generation of robot tutors that empathize with learning children. The project also developed two applications to use with such robot tutors: a treasure hunt, where children can learn about map reading and following directions; and a game about environmental considerations, learning about resources and effective ways to use them to support cities.

The robot tutors in EMOTE have personal, human elements that enable them to interact with and engage children to enhance and support their learning in a more natural way than earlier technologies. With the robots exchanging emotional cues with the children, the learning experience becomes much more fun and engaging. Children have used EMOTE's robot tutors in real classroom and field trip settings, engaging with them and enjoying this novel learning experience.
