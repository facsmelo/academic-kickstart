**Description**: 

The INSIDE initiative is driven by the following key research goals:

* Explore the scientific and technological challenges involved in developing __symbiotic human-robot interactions__ in the context of a physical game involving children. We investigate how to extend ad hoc teamwork and approaches on multiagent planning under uncertainty to cooperative scenarios involving human and robot agents.
* Explore the scientific and technological challenges involved in developing robust forms of natural interaction and how contextual and environment information (collected by a sensor network) can improve the communication between robot and human agents during joint collaborative tasks involving activities in a physical environment.

Broadly speaking, INSIDE explores the benefits that the interaction with a heterogeneous network of intelligent devices can bring to the therapy of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

In INSIDE we also investigate both novel hardware (such as biometric sensors) and processing algorithms (for example, for natural language-based interaction) that enable the system as a whole to infer the user’s behavior and goals and act upon these, facilitating a natural and cooperative interaction between the system and the human users in the context of joint human-robot cooperative tasks.
