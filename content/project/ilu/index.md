**Description**: 

The iLU project is the first initiative combining heterogeneous sources of mobility data with a broad diversity of situational context factors (such as public events, weather, accidents, public transport plans, construction works, parking density, and city ornament) for the comprehensive characterization and prediction of mobility patterns; and their proper translation into strategic and real-time public initiatives, using a selected study area.

To this end, iLU aims to learn advanced descriptive, predictive and prescriptive models from urban data produced by different sensor modalities spread across the Lisbon city, including fixed sensors (such as loop counters, surveillance cameras or machinery at public stations) and mobile sensors (carried by drivers, pedestrians and within public transports), as well as context data from complementary public repositories. 

In this context, the iLU project aims to accomplish the following six major objectives:

1. develop an integrative data repository that consolidates available urban data in the PGIL platform with potential impact on city traffic analysis. To this end, well-established principles on data integration and cleaning will be considered to: (a) guarantee the consolidation of shared attributes between different sources, (b) support automatic updates in the presence of more recent data, (c) remove errors, and (d) facilitate the subsequent development of data mining algorithms;

2. propose algorithms to learn comprehensive descriptive models of mobility dynamics and, more importantly, mine actionable traffic patterns with a focus on: (a) frequent and periodic patterns; (b) emerging patterns; (c) deviant patterns; and (d) multi-source correlations. To this end, state-of-the-art principles on urban data fusion and analytics, relational data mining, and spatiotemporal pattern mining will be considered;

3. propose superior predictive algorithms of traffic circulation from multiple sensor data sources using pattern-centric views (such as associative classifiers) and deep learning views (such as deep recurrent neural networks);

4. propose algorithms to describe and anticipate traffic dynamics in the presence of situational context data. Here, iLU focus will be placed on: (a) discovering comprehensive correlations between traffic states and situational context factors using subspace clustering; and (b) enhancing predictive algorithms in the presence of future situational context such as upcoming events or weather forecasts;

5. propose networks of reinforcement learning agents that are able to optimize traffic flow and adapt to context information (given by public events, weather forecasts, construction works). In this context, iLU will combine state-of-the-art architectures for traffic simulation with recent advances on deep reinforcement learning;

6. integrate previous descriptive, predictive and prescriptive contributions within a functional prototype and comprehensively assess its ability to support strategic decisions (such as city mobility planning) and real-time decisions (such as positive traffic conditioning through intelligent traffic lights and road message panels) using pilot initiatives.

The listed objectives build upon each other: urban data is consolidated (1) for integrative descriptive analytics (2) and the discovery of context-sensitive mobility patterns (3) that support the learning of robust predictive models (4) used within control studies (5) to support real-world decisions (6).
