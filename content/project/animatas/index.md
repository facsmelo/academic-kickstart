**Description**:

ANIMATAS is a __MSCA__ (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions) project that aims to give researchers with the necessary skills and international experience for a successful career, either in the public or the private sector. The project is an Innovative Training Network (MSCA ITN) implemented by a partnership of high profile universities, research institutions and industrial research partners that are located in 8 different countries.

ANIMATAS, in particular, aims to train a new generation of early-stage researchers (ESRs) in the emerging area of human-machine interaction for education and is structured around 15 Individual Research Projects. During four years, 15 selected ESR's will work within 3 main research topics:

1. Exploration of the fundamental questions on the perception by people of the interconnections between robots or virtual characters’ appearances and behaviors.

2. Development of new social learning mechanisms that can deal with different types of human intervention and allow robots and virtual characters to learn in an unconstrained manner.

3. Development of new approaches for robots and virtual characters' personalized adaptation to human users in unstructured and dynamically evolving social interactions.
