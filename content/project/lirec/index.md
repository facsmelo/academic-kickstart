**Description**: 

LIREC investigated the challenging problem of building long-term relationships with artificial companions. In particular, the project looked at the following research questions:

* How do we create a new computer technology that supports long-term relationships between humans and synthetic companions? To date, artificial companions have had limited abilities to support long-term, meaningful social interactions with users in real social settings.
* Whether embodied physically as a robot or as a virtual character on a screen, the LIREC network is developing methods that allow a companion to perceive, remember and react to human users, thus enabling a new generation of socially aware companions.

The research focudes on both virtual companions and physical embodiments such as robots. The research also examined how people react to a familiar companion when it migrates from a robot body into a virtual form, for example on a mobile PDA screen.

LIREC addressed a number of key scientific and technical areas, which have previously received limited examination:

* A multi-aspect (perception, memory, emotions, communication, learning) theory of artificial long-term companions.
* An extended empirical evaluation undertaken in real social settings to validate the theory developed.
* Ethological issues in developing these long term companion relationships.
* The effect of embodiment and migration on these long term companion relationships.
* The development of a guideline framework for viable long term companion technologies.
