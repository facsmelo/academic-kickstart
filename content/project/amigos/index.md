**Description**: 

The AMIGOS (Affect Modeling for robots In GrOup Social interactions) project investigated the role of emotions and adaptation in interactions between a robot and a group of users, contrasting to the typical one-robot one-­user paradigm in Human­-Robot Interaction (HRI). 

Despite the complex social challenges that long­ term HRI will soon bring, so far little is known about how perception and action selection systems, typically designed for one-­to-­one interactions, will perform in multiparty settings. Recent studies in this area indicate that data­-driven perception mechanisms trained with information from individual interactions do not generalize well in group settings, raising the need to investigate new adaptive mechanisms for robots interacting with groups of users. Previous research studied social robots in multiparty interactions, yet these robots had limited capabilities and were evaluated in single interactions with users.

AMIGOS addressed the issue of social adaptation for robots in group settings focusing on computational modeling of emotions. Emotions play a critical role in HRI. Several authors have reported the relevance of emotions in the establishment of social interactions between one robot and one user, in particular the role of empathy. AMIGOS investigated whether similar results hold (1) when aiming for longer term social interactions, and (2) when the robot is in the presence of a group of people.
